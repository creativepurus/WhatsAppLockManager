## ü™ü How to Use

### First Time Setup

1. **Set Your PIN**
   - Launch the application (requires Administrator privileges)

1. Click "Lock Web" button
2. Enter your PIN when prompted
3. The application will:
   - Modify Windows hosts file to block WhatsApp Web domains
   - Close any open browser tabs accessing WhatsApp Web
   - Confirm lock status (button turns red)

### Unlocking

1. Click "Unlock App" or "Unlock Web" button
2. Enter your 4-digit PIN
3. Access will be restored immediately
4. Status indicator returns to green

### Tips for Best Results

- Always run the application as Administrator
- Close WhatsApp Desktop before locking for clean operation
- Test lock/unlock functionality after installation
- Keep the application pinned to taskbar for quick access
- Review activity logs to monitor all operations

### Advanced Lock Options

- Left Side: type `1` ‚Üí Lock Standard WhatsApp (Microsoft Store version)
